    Description:<br>Heatmap of California showing Median Monthly Housing Costs and Number of Latinx people whose income was below the poverty level. <br>Census data is very valuable and allows us to make neat visualizations like this one to easily identify correlations between data.<br> In this case, one might find correlation between monthly housing costs and how it affects the number of Latinx people who are below the poverty level.
